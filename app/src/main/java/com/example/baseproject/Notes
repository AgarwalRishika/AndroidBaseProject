1)  If your tests rely on resources, enable the includeAndroidResources option in your app's
build.gradle file. Your unit tests can then access compiled versions of your resources, allowing the
tests to run more quickly and accurately.
                  testOptions {
                         unitTests {
                             includeAndroidResources = true}}
